### List of TODO
#### Request logic as following:
- [x] Request Fields(Deal Unique Id, From Currency ISO Code "Ordering Currency", To Currency ISO Code, Deal timestamp, Deal Amount in ordering currency).

- [x] Validate row structure.(e.g: Missing fields, Type format..etc. We do not expect you to cover all possible cases but we'll look to how you'll implement validations)


- [x] No rollback allowed, what every rows imported should be saved in DB.


- [x] System should not import same request twice.

#### Deliverables should be ready to work including:

- [x] Use Actual Db, you can select between (Postgres, MySql or MongoDB)

- [x] Maven or Gradle project is required for full source code.

- [x] Proper Logging.


- [x] Proper error/exception handling.

- [x] @ Workable deployment including sample file (Docker Compose).

- [x]  Delivered over Githhub.com.

- [x]  Proper documentation using md.

- [x]  Proper unit testing with respected Coverage.

- [x]  Makefile to streamline running application (plus).
